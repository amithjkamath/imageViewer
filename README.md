imageViewer
===========

this is a simple image viewer based on QT 4.8 It is an extension of the tutorial at http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/widgets-imageviewer.html

Some of the features that have been added are:

Image editing:
inverting the image,
converting to grayscale,
adding a sepia filter,

rotating the image,

Image enhancement:
changing the brightness,
changing the saturation,
blurring the image,
equalizing histograms,
changing the contrast.

There are some additional UI changes like a toolbar for commonly used buttons and a statusbar that shows what the image size is. 

There is an option to save the image as well. 

Future plans are to integrate this with openCV, and add some more advanced image processing capabilities to the viewer.
